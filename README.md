# A simple collection of my bash scripts

* **File Counter script** \
  As the name suggests, this script allows you to count files with a specified extension in the current working directory. If no extension is specified, all files will be counted.\

* **Simple Log File Analyzer** \
  This script let's you extract a .txt file with log entries based on your keyword input. The data is then saved to a file *timestamp*.txt and can be accesed right afterwards with nano or other text editor (just change it in the source file)\
